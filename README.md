# show-helpers
This repo contains scripts and resources that I use while doing
sound design, RF coordination, and other theatre tech stuff.

Items here are free to use and modify as you see fit, unless marked
otherwise. Everything should be considered development/alpha code.
Use at your own risk. Your mileage may vary. Etc. etc. etc.
